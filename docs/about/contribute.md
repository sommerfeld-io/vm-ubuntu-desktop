## Code
We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. You can do this by submitting a pull request.

- Take a look at our [Development Guide](development-guide.md) to get an idea of how we work
- Fork and clone the repository
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
- Make your changes and include tests (preferably by using TDD and maybe BDD)
- Make sure the tests pass
- Format code and build artifacts
- Push to your fork and submit a pull request
- Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Write tests
- Make sure the documentation (in `docs` folder) and any other relevant documentation (e.g. inline docs) are kept up-to-date
- We follow SemVer v2.0.0 so randomly breaking public APIs is not an option
- Keep your change as focused as possible - If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests
- Write [good commit messages](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
