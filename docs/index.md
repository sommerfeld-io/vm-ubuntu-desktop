## Requirements and Features
Automated and fully reproducible setup of a Ubuntu Desktop VM making the virtual machine ready for development. By doing this, the virtual machine becomes disposable and can be recreated at any time.

```

The VM represents a sandbox and development environment for Kubernetes-related tasks, proof-of-concepts and experiments. The bootstrap script installs Docker and minikube (among other tools).

## Provisioning
The provisioning is done by a bootstrap script. The script installs all needed packages and configures the VM. However, some manual steps after running the script might still remain.

A prerequisite is that the VM has internet access and `curl` installed.

- Run Bootstrap script:
    ```bash
    sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sommerfeld-io/vm-ubuntu/refs/heads/main/components/provision/bootstrap.sh | bash -
    ```
- Git might still need some configuration - e.g. `git config --global user.email sebastian@sommerfeld.io` and `git config --global user.name sebastian`.
- d.+: Configure public key on GitHub to allow cloning repositories, pulling and pushing via ssh.
- Maybe you still need to add your user from inside the VM to the docker group
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
    ```

## Run locally with Vagrant
To test the provisioning scripts locally, you can use Vagrant. The `Vagrantfile` is already included in this repository. To start/stop the Vagrantbox, simply use the `vagrant.sh` script from the root of this repository (next to the `Vagrantfile`). The `bootstrap.sh` script is used to provision the Vagrantbox.

- Maybe you still need to add the `vagrant` user to the docker group (first connect to the Vagrantbox using `vagrant ssh`)
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
    ```

## Compliance Tests
This repository provides a [Chef InSpec](https://docs.chef.io/inspec) profile designed to verify the installation of required packages, binaries, and software, ensuring that they are present and correctly installed. The profile checks for essential components, including package installations, the existence and permissions of binaries, and verifies the proper structure of the filesystem. Additionally, it ensures that utility scripts and configurations needed for Minikube are in place as expected.

On top of that, the [dev-sec/linux-baseline](https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline) is executed as well to check the security of the system.

The InSpec binary is installed from the bootstrap script.

Invoke the test suite by cloning the repository and running `components/test-compliance/run.sh`.
