# Markdown from Source Code files

To generate markdown from source code files, you can tools like [shdoc](https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc). shdoc is originally designed
to work with shell scripts, but it can be used with any file that uses the hash-sign (`#`) for comments. So e.g. Dockerfiles, Vagrantfiles, Yaml files and others can be used with shdoc as well.

For installation instructions, please refer to the [shdoc documentation](https://github.com/reconquest/shdoc).
